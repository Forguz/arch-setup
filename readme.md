# Arch Personal Fast Setup

Run the `setup.sh` script after creating your first user

Set the best mirrors for BR based users

This will add configurations to:
- Kitty
- Zsh
- OhMyZsh
- P10k

It's not adding any GUI, you'll have to do it manually after the installation

The following are the ones I personally prefer:
- [Gnome](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME)
- [KDE](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/KDE)
- [Hyprland](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hyprland)
