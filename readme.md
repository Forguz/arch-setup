# Arch Personal Fast Setup
It uses ansible-playbook to create a fast and easy to use Arch post-installation setup.

Run the `setup.sh` script after creating your first user.

This ansible will provide configurations for the following apps:
- Kitty
- Zsh
- OhMyZsh
- P10k

The script will also add the best mirrors for people located in Brazil, making the installation faster for those poor souls.

It's not adding any GUI, you'll have to do it manually after the installation.
The following GUI are the ones I personally prefer:
- [Gnome](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME)
- [KDE](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/KDE)
- [Hyprland](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hyprland)
- [Xfce](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xfce)
